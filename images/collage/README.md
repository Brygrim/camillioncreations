## Image Files

All 27 images follow the naming convention `collage-1.jpg` through `collage-27.jpg`:

| Filename | Display Time | Delay |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| `collage-1.jpg` | 0-5 sec | 0s |
| `collage-2.jpg` | 5-10 sec | 5s |
| `collage-3.jpg` | 10-15 sec | 10s |
| ... | ... | ... |
| `collage-27.jpg` | 130-135 sec | 130s |

**Full cycle time:** 135 seconds (2 minutes 15 seconds) before looping.

## How It Works

- Images **auto-crossfade** every 5 seconds
- Each transition takes ~2 seconds
- **Slow zoom effect** while each image is visible
- **Subtle grayscale** filter (20%) for elegant mood
- Full cycle repeats infinitely

## Image Tips

| Recommendation | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| Use **JPG format** | Smaller file size, faster loading |
| **1200-1600px wide** | Good quality, not too heavy |
| **Landscape orientation** | Fills screen better |
| **Keep under 2MB each** | 27 images = significant total load |
